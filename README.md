# Recursive Maze Solver - Visualized

### Description

* This script will take a 'N by N' (pixels) png of a maze that has a 1-pixel-wide wall and a 1-pixe-wide path, and find the solution. 
* It utilizes recursive backtracking to find the solution.
* The solution will be highlighted in green, and all traversed paths are highlighted in purple. 
* PIL (Python Imaging Library) will need to be installed and imported for this script to work. 

### Usage

Drop an NxN pixel PNG of a maze with a 1-pixel-wide path and 1-pixel-wide walls named "maze.png" in the same directory as the script and run it.



#### Example Input:

![Example](maze.png)

#### Example Output:

![Solution](solution.png)
